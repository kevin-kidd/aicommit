- üñ•Ô∏è CLI tool for easy integration into your workflow
- üìù VS Code extension for seamless integration within the editor
- üîó LazyGit integration for streamlined Git operations

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation

### CLI Tool

```bash
bun add -g @kkidd/aicommit
```

### VS Code Extension

The VS Code extension is available in the marketplace: [AI Commit - Generate Commit Messages](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kevin-kidd.aicommit-vscode)

## Usage

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Generate commit messages
aic generate [--amount <number>]

# Configure AI provider and model
aic config [options]

# View current configuration
aic view-config

# Set up integrations
aic integrate
```

### Configuration Options

- For initial setup or to update all settings, run `aic config` without options
- `--provider`: AI provider (openai, openai-compatible, anthropic, openrouter, groq)
- `--model`: AI model to use
- `--api-key`: API key for the selected provider
- `--endpoint`: Endpoint for OpenAI compatible providers
- `--tokens`: Maximum number of tokens to generate
- `--integration`: Integration to use (lazygit / vscode)

## Integrations

### LazyGit

To set up the LazyGit integration:

1. Run `aic integrate`
2. Choose "LazyGit" from the options
3. Follow the prompts to configure your LazyGit config file

### VS Code

To set up the VS Code integration:

1. Install the AI Commit extension from the VS Code marketplace
2. Configure the extension settings in VS Code:
   - AI provider
   - API key
   - Model
   - Max tokens
   - Number of commit messages to generate
   - Endpoint (for other OpenAI compatible provider)

## Configuration

AI Commit uses a configuration file to store your preferences. You can edit this file directly or use the `aic config` command to update your settings.

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "apiKey": "your-api-key-here",
  "maxTokens": 256,
  "integration": "lazygit",
  "endpoint": "https://example.com/v1/"
}
