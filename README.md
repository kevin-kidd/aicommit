## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation

### CLI Tool

```bash
bun add -g @kkidd/aicommit
```

### VS Code Extension

The VS Code extension will be available in the marketplace in the next month.

## Usage

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Generate commit messages
aic generate [--amount <number>]

# Configure AI provider and model
aic config [options]

# View current configuration
aic view-config

# Set up integrations
aic integrate
```

### Configuration Options

- `--provider`: AI provider (openai, openai-compatible, anthropic, openrouter, groq)
- `--model`: AI model to use
- `--api-key`: API key for the selected provider
- `--endpoint`: Endpoint for OpenAI compatible providers
- `--tokens`: Maximum number of tokens to generate

## Integrations

### LazyGit

To set up the LazyGit integration:

1. Run `aic integrate`
2. Choose "LazyGit" from the options
3. Follow the prompts to configure your LazyGit config file

### VS Code (coming soon)

To set up the VS Code integration:

  "model": "gpt-4",
  "apiKey": "your-api-key-here",
  "maxTokens": 256
}
```
